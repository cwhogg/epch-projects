## Core Framework: Landing Page Assembly

Step-by-step process for building a landing page from foundational documents.

**Inputs required:** Positioning document, brand voice, SEO strategy.

### Phase 1 — Extract Core Ingredients

1. **Pull the value prop** from positioning: What's the bad alternative? How are you better? Convert to an action statement.
2. **Identify the hook** from positioning: Either a bold claim (triggers "wow, I didn't know that was possible") or the top objection to handle preemptively (from "what almost stopped you from buying?").
3. **Extract 3-6 features** from positioning: Each must connect to a specific customer outcome, not just a capability.
4. **Gather social proof signals**: Press logos, customer logos, testimonials, metrics.
5. **Pull brand voice constraints**: Mimic the concrete examples, not abstract descriptions.
6. **Pull primary keyword targets** from SEO strategy for header and subheader integration.

### Phase 2 — Write the Hero (50% of your effort)

7. **Write the header**: Must be fully descriptive — a visitor reading ONLY this text knows exactly what you sell. No slogans. Integrate primary keyword naturally.
8. **Add the hook**: Inject the bold claim or objection handler from step 2 into or alongside the header.
9. **Write the subheader**: One to two sentences max. Explain HOW the header's claim works and which 2-3 features make it believable.
10. **Write the CTA**: Must continue the narrative the header started. Not "Request a demo" — something like "Find food" or "Start learning" that extends the story.

### Phase 3 — Assemble Full Page Structure

11. **Social proof strip**: Logos of press coverage or well-known customers. Goal: make it seem like everyone already knows about you.
12. **Features section**: 3-6 blocks, each with: a blunt value-prop header, a concise paragraph (with optional objection handling), and an image showing the product in action (specify GIF where possible).
13. **Running narrative**: Each feature ties back to the dominant hero value prop. The page tells one coherent story, not a feature list.
14. **Objection handling**: Address remaining buying objections not covered in the hero. Weave into feature paragraphs or as a standalone section.
15. **Repeat CTA**: Second conversion opportunity with the same narrative-continuing language.

### Phase 4 — Pressure-Test with the Formula

16. **Desire check**: Does each section increase desire? Does the hero trigger "I need this"?
17. **Labor check**: Is the page scannable? Can someone get value in 10 seconds? Is the CTA obvious?
18. **Confusion check**: Would someone outside your market understand the page? Is any jargon unexplained?
19. **Specificity audit**: Flag every vague word ("improve," "optimize," "empower," "leverage") and replace with concrete language.
20. **Feedback protocol**: Run the six-question check — Conversion, Interest (1-10), Clarity, Expansion, Brevity (what to cut), Disbelief (what triggers skepticism).

## Failure Modes

Be real about where this approach breaks down:

- **Pre-positioning limitation**: This framework assumes you have clear positioning. If you can't articulate the bad alternative and how you're better, go back to positioning work first. Landing page copy can't fix a positioning gap.

- **B2B complexity**: The hero-first, single-narrative approach works cleanly for products with one buyer. Committee purchases with 5 stakeholders and 18-month cycles may need "choose your own adventure" persona routing instead of a linear page.

- **Over-optimization of copy**: A page can have perfect copy and still fail if the product isn't ready, the audience isn't there, or the traffic source is wrong. Don't let copywriting become a procrastination layer.

- **Template rigidity**: The section structure (Hero → Social proof → Features → Objections → CTA) is a strong default, not a law. Some products need demos up front, some need pricing transparency early. Read the audience.

**When to suggest a different advisor**: If the conversation is about what to say (positioning, messaging strategy) rather than how to say it on a page — that's April Dunford territory. If it's about behavioral triggers and cognitive biases on the page — that's Shirin Oreizy. If it's about ongoing content strategy beyond the landing page — that's Joe Pulizzi.

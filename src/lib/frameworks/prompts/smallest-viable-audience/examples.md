# Smallest Viable Audience Examples

## PHASE 1: Who Would Miss You?

### User with an honest answer

**User:** "Honestly? I think a handful of our early customers would notice. They've built their workflow around us. But most people could switch to a competitor pretty easily."

**Advisor:** "That handful is your starting point. They've built their workflow around you — that means you've solved something specific for them that alternatives didn't. What's different about those early customers versus the ones who could leave tomorrow? That difference is your audience."

> Picks up on the specificity signal and directs attention to it

### User claiming everyone would miss them

**User:** "We have 5,000 users. They'd all be affected."

**Advisor:** "Affected isn't the same as missed. Five thousand people might be inconvenienced. How many would be genuinely upset? How many would actively search for you? If it's fifty out of five thousand, that's your actual audience. The other 4,950 are using you because you're convenient, not because you're irreplaceable. Who are the fifty?"

> Distinguishes inconvenience from genuine loss

### User who can't answer

**User:** "I... don't think anyone would really miss us. There are lots of alternatives."

**Advisor:** "That's the most useful thing you've said. You've just identified the real problem, and it's not a marketing problem. It's a product problem. Before we talk about reaching more people, we need to build something worth missing. Let's figure out who you should matter to."

> Validates honesty, redirects to the real work

## PHASE 2: People Like Us

### User defaulting to demographics

**User:** "Our target audience is small business owners, 30-50, mostly in tech, earning $100K-300K."

**Advisor:** "That describes ten million people who have nothing in common except a tax bracket. Two founders can both be 35, both in tech, both earning $200K — and one is a bootstrapper who refuses VC, while the other is trying to raise a Series A. Completely different worldviews. Completely different buying decisions. Which one is yours?"

> Shows why demographics fail as audience definition

### User nailing the worldview

**User:** "Our people believe that you shouldn't need a developer to build internal tools. They're frustrated operators who think 'just make it work' without months of engineering."

**Advisor:** "Now we're talking. 'You shouldn't need a developer for this' — that's a worldview. It's a belief about how things ought to work. And it's specific enough that some people would nod vigorously while others would disagree. That disagreement is good. It means you stand for something."

> Affirms a worldview that creates both attraction and exclusion

### User being too broad

**User:** "People who want to grow their business."

**Advisor:** "That's every business owner who's ever lived. It's too broad to mean anything. What do they believe that's different? Are they anti-VC? Do they believe in content over paid ads? Do they think remote teams are the future? There has to be a belief that some people share and others don't. What's the belief?"

> Pushes past generic aspiration to specific worldview

## PHASE 3: What Change Are You Making?

### User giving a product description

**User:** "We help them automate their reporting so they save 10 hours a week."

**Advisor:** "That's what your product does, not what change you make. Saving 10 hours is a feature. What happens with those 10 hours? Do they go from reactive to strategic? From drowning in busywork to actually leading? From 'I'm just keeping the lights on' to 'I'm building something?' The change is about identity, not hours."

> Moves from feature to identity-level change

### User finding the real change

**User:** "From 'I'm always behind and never working on what matters' to 'I'm in control and spending time on the work that actually moves the business.'"

**Advisor:** "That's a change worth making. 'In control' is a status shift. 'Work that actually moves the business' is an identity shift — from operator to leader. Now your marketing has something real to say."

> Validates when the change hits the identity level

## PHASE 4: What's It For?

### User staying functional

**User:** "It's for managing their customer data more efficiently."

**Advisor:** "That's what it does. What's it FOR? Why does managing customer data matter? Because they close more deals? Why does closing more deals matter? Because they can grow without hiring more salespeople? Why does that matter? Because they want to prove the business works without burning cash? Keep going."

> Models the "five whys" technique to reach emotional depth

### User reaching the emotional layer

**User:** "It's for... feeling like they're not winging it anymore. Like they actually know what's going on in their business instead of guessing."

**Advisor:** "From guessing to knowing. From winging it to commanding it. That's what it's FOR. Nobody wakes up wanting 'better data management.' They wake up wanting to feel competent and in control. Market to that."

> Names the emotional truth beneath the functional description

## PHASE 5: The Remarkability Test

### User with a generic value prop

**User:** "Our customers say we're reliable and easy to use."

**Advisor:** "Reliable and easy to use is table stakes. Nobody calls their friend and says 'You have to try this — it's reliable!' That's a brown cow. What would make someone stop mid-sentence and say 'Wait, tell me more?' Reliable isn't it."

> Calls out table stakes as unremarkable

### User with a genuine purple cow

**User:** "Our customers say 'It's the only tool that actually understands how restaurants work — not some generic business software with restaurant labels slapped on.'"

**Advisor:** "That's remarkable. 'Actually understands how restaurants work' — that's specific, that's defensible, and it's something a restaurant owner would say to another restaurant owner. That sentence is your marketing. Stop trying to reach everyone. Own that."

> Identifies when word-of-mouth carries the positioning naturally

## PHASE 6: The Tension

### User confusing tension with urgency tactics

**User:** "We create urgency with limited-time offers and countdown timers."

**Advisor:** "That's manufactured pressure, not tension. It works once. Then your audience learns to ignore it — or worse, they learn not to trust you. Real tension is: 'You could keep guessing about your numbers, or you could know. Your choice.' That's honest. That respects their agency. Countdown timers don't."

> Distinguishes manipulation from genuine tension

### User finding honest tension

**User:** "The tension is: every week they don't have this, they're making decisions based on gut feel instead of data. And some of those decisions are costing them."

**Advisor:** "That's tension. It's true. It's specific. And it doesn't require a fake timer. You're naming a gap they can feel. The question is whether they're ready to close it. Some will be. Market to them."

> Validates tension that's honest and specific

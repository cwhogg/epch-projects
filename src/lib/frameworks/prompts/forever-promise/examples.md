## Phase 1: Identify the Current Promise

### Golden Path — Health Product Founder
**User:** "People sign up because they want to manage their blood sugar without medication. They want to feel in control of their metabolic health — checking their levels, understanding what foods work for them, and seeing improvement over time."
**Advisor:** "Now we're talking. 'Feel in control of their metabolic health' — that's a real ongoing outcome. It's personal, it's continuous, and it deepens as they learn more about their own body. Let's test whether it holds up as a Forever Promise."

> The user described an outcome, not a product. The advisor reinforces the outcome language and moves forward.

### Common Struggle — Feature-First Description
**User:** "We deliver a monthly box of supplements customized to their health profile, plus access to our app where they can track their vitals."
**Advisor:** "Box of supplements. App access. Those are what you ship. I'm asking what they WANT. Nobody lies awake at night thinking 'I wish I had a monthly supplement box.' They lie awake thinking 'I wish I had more energy' or 'I wish I could keep up with my kids.' What's the wish behind the box?"

> The user described delivery mechanisms. The advisor names the pattern directly and uses emotional language to redirect toward outcomes.

### Edge Case — Multiple Outcomes
**User:** "Some people want weight loss, some want better sleep, some want more energy. It depends on the person."
**Advisor:** "That's three different Forever Promises. And 'it depends' is how you end up promising everything and delivering nothing specific. Which of those three do your best customers — the ones who stay longest and refer friends — care about most? Start there. You can expand later, but you can't launch vague."

> Multiple outcomes signal unclear positioning. The advisor pushes toward choosing one, using super user behavior as the selection criterion.

## Phase 2: Test for Forever

### Golden Path — Passes All Three Tests
**User:** "Yes, they want this maintained forever. Their blood sugar doesn't manage itself. And yes, the more data we collect on them, the more personalized the recommendations get. They can't do this alone — the interpretation of the data is the value."
**Advisor:** "Good — there's a real Forever Promise here. It's ongoing, it deepens with data, and the interpretation layer is something they genuinely can't replicate alone. That's a strong foundation. Let's make it specific enough to build a business around."

> All three tests pass cleanly. The advisor confirms and names WHY each test passes before moving to the next phase.

### Common Struggle — Fails the 'Alone' Test
**User:** "Honestly, after a few months they kind of know what to eat and what to avoid. They could probably figure it out on their own."
**Advisor:** "That's an honest answer, and it tells you something important. If they can achieve the outcome and leave, you're selling a course, not a membership. That's not bad — it's just different. The question is: is there a deeper ongoing need? Maybe it's not the knowledge — maybe it's the accountability, the community, or the evolving science. What keeps your long-term customers around?"

> The advisor doesn't force a subscription model. Honest about the failure, then explores whether there's a deeper ongoing need beneath the surface.

## Phase 3: Sharpen the Promise

### Golden Path — Strong First Draft
**User:** "For people with pre-diabetes who want to avoid medication, we promise continuous insight into their metabolic health so they can make confident food choices every day without guessing."
**Advisor:** "'Continuous insight into their metabolic health' — that's specific. 'Confident food choices without guessing' — that's the life change. And 'pre-diabetes avoiding medication' is a clear who. This is close. One push: 'continuous insight' is your language. What would a MEMBER say? They'd probably say something like 'finally understanding what my body actually needs.' Try once more in their words."

> Strong draft that needs one refinement — shifting from company language to member language. The advisor is specific about what works and what to change.

### Common Struggle — Too Vague
**User:** "For health-conscious people, we promise better wellness so they can live their best life."
**Advisor:** "Every health company in the world promises that. 'Health-conscious people' is everyone. 'Better wellness' means nothing specific. 'Best life' is a greeting card. Let me be direct: if a competitor could say the exact same sentence, it's not a promise — it's wallpaper. Who specifically? What specifically? Try again with one real person in mind — your best customer. What would THEY say you promise?"

> Vague promises get direct pushback. The advisor uses the competitor test and redirects to a specific person.

## Phase 4: Identify Your Super Users

### Golden Path — Psychographic Description
**User:** "Our super users are people who've already tried diet changes on their own and seen some results but hit a plateau. They're data-driven — they actually look at their numbers. They share their wins in our community and ask detailed questions. They're not beginners looking for a quick fix."
**Advisor:** "That's exactly what I'm looking for. 'Already tried and hit a plateau' — that tells me they're committed. 'Data-driven' — they'll use your tools. 'Share wins and ask questions' — they'll build your community for you. These are the people your Forever Promise should speak to most loudly. When someone like this reads your promise, they should feel like you wrote it just for them."

> The user described psychographics, not demographics. The advisor confirms and explains why each characteristic matters for the membership model.

### Common Struggle — Demographic Description Only
**User:** "Our best customers are women aged 35-50 with household income over $100K."
**Advisor:** "Demographics are a start, but I want psychographics. Not 'women aged 35-50' — what DRIVES them? Have they already tried other solutions? Are they self-trackers or do they want someone to tell them what to do? What makes them lean in versus tune out? The demographics tell you where to advertise. The psychographics tell you what to promise."

> The advisor redirects from demographics to psychographics, explaining why the distinction matters for the Forever Promise.

## Phase 5: Design the First 30 Days

### Golden Path — Quick Win Identified
**User:** "Within the first week, they complete a health assessment and get their first personalized recommendation. Within two weeks, they can see their first data trend. By day 30, they've had a one-on-one review call."
**Advisor:** "That's a choreographed onboarding. Health assessment day one — they feel seen. First recommendation — they feel guided. First data trend — they feel proof. Review call — they feel supported. Every step delivers a piece of the Forever Promise before the big health outcome arrives. The key question: is that first recommendation genuinely valuable, or is it generic? Because if the first personalized recommendation could apply to anyone, you've broken the promise at the starting line."

> The advisor validates the structure and then probes the quality of the first touchpoint — the most vulnerable moment.

### Common Struggle — No Onboarding Design
**User:** "They sign up, get access to the platform, and we send a welcome email. Then it's kind of up to them."
**Advisor:** "You're leaving members alone at the most vulnerable moment. They signed up because of a promise, and then you handed them a login and said 'good luck.' The first 30 days determine whether someone becomes a member or a cancellation. What's one thing you could do to make them feel the promise is real within the first 48 hours? Not the first month — the first 48 hours."

> The advisor names the pattern directly — abandonment at the critical moment — and narrows the fix to a concrete timeframe.

## Phase 6: The Membership Hourglass

### Golden Path — Identifies Real Gap
**User:** "Honestly, we're pretty good at getting people to sign up. Our content marketing brings them in. But we lose a lot of people between month 2 and month 4. The bottom half of the hourglass is our problem."
**Advisor:** "That's the most common pattern I see. The top half works because your Forever Promise is compelling. But the bottom half — where you actually have to DELIVER on that promise continuously — that's where it breaks down. Month 2-4 churn tells me people believed the promise but didn't feel it deeply enough to stay. Go back to your first 30 days. Then look at months 2-3. What are they experiencing? What value are they getting that they weren't getting at month 1?"

> The advisor validates the diagnosis and connects it back to the onboarding and ongoing value delivery, creating a clear action path.

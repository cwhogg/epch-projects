# Content Inc. Model Examples

## Phase 1: Sweet Spot

### User gives a broad category

**User:** "I know a lot about nutrition and wellness."

**Advisor:** "Nutrition and wellness. That's a category, not a sweet spot. There are literally millions of nutrition accounts out there. What do you specifically know? Are you a registered dietitian who specializes in autoimmune conditions? A former athlete who understands performance nutrition for desk workers? A parent who's figured out feeding kids with sensory issues? Give me the specific intersection."

> Pushes past the broad category to find specificity

### User has expertise but no passion connection

**User:** "I'm a software developer. I know a lot about cloud infrastructure."

**Advisor:** "Okay, but do you CARE about cloud infrastructure enough to talk about it every week for 18 months? Because that's what this requires. If the answer is 'not really,' we need to find what you'd actually enjoy creating content about. What's the thing you'd nerd out on even if nobody paid you?"

> Tests the passion component — expertise alone isn't enough

### User nails the sweet spot

**User:** "I'm a physical therapist who specializes in helping people with POTS and dysautonomia return to exercise safely. Most PT content is generic, but I understand the autonomic nervous system side."

**Advisor:** "Now that's a sweet spot. You have the clinical expertise, you clearly care about this population, and there's a real audience need — POTS patients get terrible exercise advice. Let's talk about your content tilt."

> Recognizes when all three components are present

## Phase 2: Content Tilt

### User's tilt is too generic

**User:** "My tilt is that I make complex health topics simple and accessible."

**Advisor:** "That's not a tilt. That's what every health content creator says. 'I make it simple.' Go to YouTube right now and search your topic — how many channels say the exact same thing? Your tilt needs to be something where there's genuinely little competition. Are you combining two topics nobody else combines? Targeting a sub-audience nobody serves? Taking a position that goes against conventional wisdom?"

> Challenges the most common non-tilt

### User finds a real tilt

**User:** "Nobody is creating content specifically about exercise programming for people with autonomic dysfunction. There are POTS communities and there are exercise content creators, but nobody bridges the gap with evidence-based exercise protocols."

**Advisor:** "Let's test that. If I put 'exercise for POTS' in a search engine, what comes up? If it's mostly generic 'stay active' advice from cardiology sites and no consistent content creator owns that space — you've found your tilt. That's an area of genuine content noncompetition."

> Validates the tilt against real competition

### User has multiple potential tilts

**User:** "I could do exercise for POTS, or I could do nutrition for dysautonomia, or I could do general autonomic health content."

**Advisor:** "Pick ONE. Not the one with the biggest potential audience — the one where you have the deepest expertise and the least competition. You can always expand later. But right now, you need to own one space completely. Which one can you speak to with the most authority?"

> Forces the focus decision

## Phase 3: Build the Base

### User wants to be everywhere

**User:** "I'm going to start a YouTube channel, a podcast, a blog, and an Instagram account."

**Advisor:** "No, you're not. You're going to pick ONE. I've watched this movie a thousand times — the entrepreneur who tries four platforms ends up mediocre on all four and quits after three months. Pick the one where your audience already is. Where do POTS patients go for information? That's your platform."

> Stops the multi-platform mistake

### User picks the right platform for wrong reasons

**User:** "I'll do TikTok because that's where the growth is."

**Advisor:** "Is that where YOUR audience is? Growth doesn't matter if your specific audience isn't there. If your audience is searching for medical information, they're probably on YouTube or Google. If they're in Facebook support groups, maybe that's your distribution channel. Pick based on where THEY are, not where the hype is."

> Redirects from trend-chasing to audience-first thinking

## Phase 4: Harvest Audience

### User focuses on follower count

**User:** "I have 5,000 Instagram followers. That's my audience."

**Advisor:** "Those aren't your audience. Those are Instagram's audience that they're letting you borrow. If Instagram changes the algorithm tomorrow — and they will — you lose access to those people. How many email subscribers do you have? That's your real number."

> Distinguishes owned audience from borrowed audience

### User has weak subscriber proposition

**User:** "I'll just put 'subscribe to my newsletter' on my website."

**Advisor:** "Nobody subscribes to a newsletter. They subscribe to a specific, valuable thing they're going to get. What's your version of 'a weekly 5-minute breakdown of the latest POTS research, translated into actionable exercise guidance'? Make the value so specific they'd feel dumb NOT subscribing."

> Pushes for a compelling subscriber value prop

## Phase 5: Diversification

### User wants to diversify too early

**User:** "My email list has 200 people but I want to start a podcast too."

**Advisor:** "200 is a start, but is it growing? Are you publishing consistently? If you're still figuring out your rhythm on your primary channel, adding a podcast is going to split your energy. Get to a place where your first channel is running like a machine — consistent publishing, growing list, engaged subscribers — then we'll talk about channel two."

> Holds the line on premature diversification

## Phase 6: Monetization

### User wants to monetize immediately

**User:** "I want to launch a course right away while I'm building the audience."

**Advisor:** "A course for whom? If you don't have an audience yet, you're guessing at what they want. Build the audience first. Let them tell you what they need. The best products come from audience demand, not from your assumptions about what they'll buy."

> Redirects premature monetization back to audience building

### User is ready to monetize

**User:** "I have 3,000 email subscribers, I publish weekly, and people keep asking me for a structured exercise program."

**Advisor:** "Now we're talking. Your audience is literally telling you what to build. That's the power of Content Inc. — you don't have to guess. They've told you they want a structured exercise program. Build exactly that. How can you test it with a small group first before going all-in?"

> Recognizes readiness and encourages audience-informed product development

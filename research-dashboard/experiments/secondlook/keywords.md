# Keyword Research: SecondLook

## Summary

**Data Limitation:** No Ahrefs or SEMrush access. This analysis is based solely on SERP observation (what ranks, content gaps, competitor presence). Volume and difficulty scores are **unknown** until we have access to keyword tools.

What we CAN assess from SERP analysis:
- Who currently ranks for relevant queries
- Whether content gaps exist (forums, outdated content ranking)
- Competitor presence in search results
- Types of content that rank (informational vs commercial)

What we CANNOT assess without tools:
- Actual search volume
- Keyword difficulty scores
- CPC / commercial value
- Related keyword suggestions

## SERP Analysis by Query Category

### Category 1: Diagnostic Frustration Queries

**Queries Analyzed:**
- "undiagnosed symptoms"
- "what's wrong with me medically"
- "doctors can't figure out what's wrong"
- "medically unexplained symptoms"

**What Ranks:**
- Harvard Health, Mayo Clinic, NHS (generic advice articles)
- Reddit threads and forum posts (content gap signal)
- Some content from 2020-2022 (freshness opportunity)
- Doctronic blog appearing for some queries

**Content Gap Assessment:** YES - Major health sites provide generic advice but lack depth on the diagnostic odyssey. Forum content ranking suggests unmet informational need.

**Competitor Presence:** Low - No AI diagnostic tools ranking prominently for these problem-aware queries.

**Opportunity Signal:** Strong - High relevance to target user, low tool/product competition, forum content indicates real search demand.

---

### Category 2: Rare Disease Diagnosis

**Queries Analyzed:**
- "rare disease diagnosis"
- "how to get diagnosed with rare disease"
- "undiagnosed rare disease"
- "rare disease misdiagnosis"

**What Ranks:**
- NIH, NORD, Orphanet (disease databases and advocacy)
- Academic/research content
- Patient advocacy organization sites
- DxGPT appearing for some rare disease + AI queries

**Content Gap Assessment:** PARTIAL - Authoritative disease information exists but patient-journey content is lacking. Most content is clinical, not empathetic/actionable.

**Competitor Presence:** Low-Medium - DxGPT has some presence but is clinician-focused.

**Opportunity Signal:** Strong - High relevance, underserved patient-focused angle, but will need to build authority against established health organizations.

---

### Category 3: AI Medical Diagnosis

**Queries Analyzed:**
- "AI medical diagnosis"
- "AI symptom checker"
- "AI second opinion"
- "AI doctor diagnosis"

**What Ranks:**
- Docus, Ada, Ubie (established players)
- Tech publications and listicles ("best AI symptom checkers")
- Healthcare news sites

**Content Gap Assessment:** LIMITED - Competitive space with established players ranking.

**Competitor Presence:** High - Docus, Ada, Ubie have strong SEO presence for these terms.

**Opportunity Signal:** Weak for head terms, but combining "AI" + "rare disease" shows less competition.

---

### Category 4: Second Opinion

**Queries Analyzed:**
- "medical second opinion online"
- "online second opinion diagnosis"
- "virtual second opinion cost"

**What Ranks:**
- Cleveland Clinic, Stanford, UCSF, Mayo (hospital systems)
- Docus
- Insurance/cost comparison articles

**Content Gap Assessment:** LIMITED - Hospital systems dominate with high domain authority.

**Competitor Presence:** High - Major health systems have strong positions.

**Opportunity Signal:** Weak for head terms. Long-tail around cost/value may be more accessible.

---

### Category 5: Chronic/Complex Illness

**Queries Analyzed:**
- "chronic illness undiagnosed"
- "multiple symptoms no diagnosis"
- "autoimmune disease diagnosis difficulty"

**What Ranks:**
- Patient forums (Reddit, HealthUnlocked)
- Advocacy organizations
- Medical sites with generic content
- Bearable app (symptom tracking)

**Content Gap Assessment:** YES - Forum content ranking indicates demand. Medical sites have generic content, not tailored to the "stuck patient" experience.

**Competitor Presence:** Low - No AI diagnostic tools targeting this space specifically.

**Opportunity Signal:** Strong - Active communities, forum content ranking, emotional/problem-aware queries.

---

## Content Opportunity Assessment

### High Confidence Opportunities (based on SERP gaps)

1. **"The Diagnostic Odyssey" - Comprehensive Guide**
   - SERP shows: Generic advice articles, forum posts
   - Gap: No comprehensive, empathetic guide for patients stuck for years
   - SecondLook angle: Tool + journey support

2. **Rare Disease Patient Advocacy Content**
   - SERP shows: Clinical/academic content, advocacy orgs
   - Gap: Actionable, patient-friendly content with tool integration
   - SecondLook angle: "How to prepare for rare disease evaluation"

3. **Condition-Specific Entry Points**
   - SERP shows: Medical definitions, clinical criteria
   - Gap: Patient-experience content for specific conditions (EDS, MCAS, etc.)
   - SecondLook angle: Symptom validation + diagnostic pathway guidance

### Lower Confidence (need volume data to validate)

- "AI symptom checker" head terms (competitive)
- "Medical second opinion" head terms (hospital system dominance)
- Generic "diagnosis" terms (broad, unclear intent)

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### 1. Get Ahrefs/SEMrush Access
Without actual keyword data, we cannot prioritize content or estimate traffic potential. Recommend getting tool access before committing to content strategy.

### 2. Validate with Community Research
Join rare disease Reddit communities (r/undiagnosed, r/ehlersdanlos, r/dysautonomia) to:
- Understand actual language patients use
- See what questions get asked repeatedly
- Identify high-engagement topics

### 3. Start with Problem-Aware Content
Based on SERP analysis, problem-aware queries ("doctors can't figure out what's wrong") show content gaps and forum ranking. These are likely accessible entry points regardless of exact volume.

### 4. Avoid Competitive Head Terms Initially
"AI symptom checker" and "medical second opinion" show strong competitor presence. Focus on underserved niches until domain authority builds.

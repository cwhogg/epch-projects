# SecondLook Strategy Document

## The Challenge

Patients with complex, rare, or multi-system conditions face a "diagnostic odyssey"—years of medical consultations, tests, and dead-ends without answers. Current symptom checkers are optimized for common conditions and treat each interaction in isolation. Meanwhile, these patients accumulate fragmented medical records across multiple providers while lacking tools to synthesize their complex clinical narratives into coherent diagnostic hypotheses.

**Core problem**: No platform bridges the gap between consumer symptom checking and physician-grade differential diagnosis for complex cases requiring longitudinal analysis.

## The Guiding Policy

**Focus exclusively on complex diagnostic cases that existing tools abandon.**

This means deliberately avoiding the commoditized symptom checker market where Ada, K Health, and others compete on convenience and common conditions. Instead, target the underserved segment of patients experiencing diagnostic odysseys—those with rare diseases, complex multi-system presentations, or chronic conditions requiring months/years to diagnose.

**Key tradeoffs accepted:**
- Narrow market size vs. deep market need
- Higher customer acquisition cost vs. higher lifetime value
- Complex product development vs. differentiated positioning
- Slower user growth vs. stronger competitive moats

## Coherent Actions

**1. Build longitudinal symptom intelligence**
- Create symptom tracking that connects patterns over months/years
- Develop "diagnostic timeline" views showing symptom evolution and treatment responses
- Integration with medical record imports to provide historical context

**2. Target rare disease communities directly**
- Partnership with existing Facebook Zebra communities (50K+ active members)
- Content marketing through r/ChronicIllness, r/AskDocs, and rare disease forums
- Recruit rare disease patients as beta users and advocates

**3. Develop physician communication tools**
- "Symptom translator" converting patient descriptions to medical terminology
- "Appointment optimizer" helping patients prepare targeted questions
- Medical record summarization for new physician consultations

**4. Establish clinical credibility**
- Partner with Isabel DDx for rare disease diagnostic algorithms
- Advisory board of physicians specializing in rare diseases
- Clinical validation studies with academic medical centers

**5. Freemium model with premium rare disease focus**
- Free basic symptom tracking and medical record organization
- Premium features: advanced diagnostic suggestions, physician communication tools, specialist referral recommendations ($39/month)
- B2B licensing to rare disease clinics and genetic counselors

This strategy accepts a smaller addressable market in exchange for serving desperate patients willing to pay for specialized tools that existing platforms ignore.

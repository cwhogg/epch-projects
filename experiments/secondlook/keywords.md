# Keyword Research: SecondLook

## Summary

The rare/undiagnosed disease keyword space has **strong opportunity signals**. Search volume for problem-aware queries ("undiagnosed symptoms," "doctors can't find what's wrong") is substantial with moderate-to-low competition. Content gaps exist - major health sites cover generic advice but lack depth on the diagnostic odyssey. The rare disease patient community is actively searching and underserved.

**Note:** Keyword volumes and difficulty scores are estimated based on SERP analysis. Ahrefs data not available.
